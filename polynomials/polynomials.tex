\section*{Polynomials}

A polynomial is an expression composed of algebraic terms, especially the sum of several terms that contain different powers of the same variable(s).

\subsubsection*{Example}
The following is a polynomial:
$$ 7x^4 + 4x^2 + 5 $$

\subsection*{Parts of a Polynomial}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Term:} A single part of a polynomial. Also known as a monomial. In the above example, there are three non-zero terms; \( 7x^4 \), \( 4x^2 \) and \( 5 \).
    \item \textbf{Degree:} The exponent of the term with the highest power. The degree of a monomial is its own exponent. The degree of the polynomial above is 4.
    \item \textbf{Coefficient:} The number in front of the variable. In the above example, the coefficients are 7, 4 and 5 (note that the degree of the constant term is 0, and since \(x^0\) is 0).
\end{itemize}

We can present the same polynomial from above without modifying its value by adding terms such that there is a monomial with a unique degree ranging from the degree of the polynomial to zero using the zero product and zero exponent properties:
$$ 7x^4 + 0x^3 + 4x^2 + 0x^1 + 5x^0 $$

\subsection*{Representing Polynomials using Python Lists}

A polynomial can be represented using a Python list. The value of the item in the list corresponds with the coefficient of the term, and the index of the item in the list corresponds with the degree of the term. Since Python list indices start at 0, the degree of a term represented by an item in the list is the length of the list minus the index of the item minus 1.

\subsubsection*{Example}
Consider the polynomial:
$$ 7x^4 + 0x^3 + 4x^2 + 0x^1 + 5x^0 $$
This can be represented as a list in Python:
$$ [7, 0, 4, 0, 5] $$

\begin{itemize}
    \item The first item in the list, 7, represents the coefficient of the polynomial's first term (\( 7x^4 \)). The degree of the term is 4, which is equal to the length of the list (5) minus the index of the list's first item (0) minus 1 (\( 5 - 0 - 1 = 4 \)).
    \item The second item in the list, 0, represents the coefficient of the polynomial's second term (\( 0x^3 \)). The degree of the term is 3, which is equal to the length of the list (5) minus the index of the list's second item (1) minus 1 (\( 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 \)).
    \item The third item in the list, 4, represents the coefficient of the polynomial's third term (\( 4x^2 \)). The degree of the term is 2, which is equal to the length of the list (5) minus the index of the list's third item (2) minus 1 (\( 5 - 2 - 1 = 2 \)).
    \item The fourth item in the list, 0, represents the coefficient of the polynomial's fourth term (\( 0x^1 \)). The degree of the term is 1, which is equal to the length of the list (5) minus the index of the list's fourth item (3) minus 1 (\( 5 - 3 - 1 = 1 \)).
    \item The fifth item in the list, 5, represents the coefficient of the polynomial's fifth term (\( 5x^0 \)). The degree of the term is 0, which is equal to the length of the list (5) minus the index of the list's fifth item (4) minus 1 (\( 5 - 4 - 1 = 0 \)).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Multiplying Polynomials}

The multiplication of polynomials is based on the distributive law. In polynomial multiplication, we apply this rule to multiply each term of one polynomial by each term of the other, and then sum all the products. The final result is the sum of all possible products obtained by multiplying each term from the first polynomial by each term from the second polynomial. The general rule is:
$$ (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd $$

\subsection*{Example}
Consider the product of two polynomials:
$$ (3x^1+2x^0)(3x^4 + 0x^3 + 4x^2 + 0x^1 + 5x^0) $$
To expand the product of the polynomials we will multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second polynomial and then sum all the products:

$$ 3x^1(3x^4 + 0x^3 + 4x^2 + 0x^1 + 5x^0) = 9x^5 + 0x^4 + 12x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x^1 $$

$$ 2x^0(3x^4 + 0x^3 + 4x^2 + 0x^1 + 5x^0) = 6x^4 + 0x^3 + 8x^2 + 0x^1 + 10x^0 $$
